    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Our goal with this document is to improve our agreement on the terminology used in
        documents produced by the IETF Working Group for Security Automation and Continuous
        Monitoring. Agreeing on terminology should help reach consensus on which problems we're
        trying to solve, and propose solutions and decide which ones to use.</t>

    </section>


    <section anchor="sec-terms" title="Terms and Definitions">
      <t> This section describes terms that have been defined by other RFC's and defines new ones.
        The predefined terms will reference the RFC and where appropriate will be annotated with the
        specific context by which the term is used in SACM.</t>

        <t>Assessment <list>
            <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "the process of collecting posture for a set
              of capabilities on the endpoint (e.g., host-based firewall) such that the appropriate
              validators may evaluate the posture against compliance policy."</t>
            <t>Within this document the use of the term is expanded to support other uses of
              collected posture (e.g. reporting, network enforcement, vulnerability detection,
              license management). The phrase "set of capabilities on the endpoint" includes:
              hardware and software installed on the endpoint."</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Asset <list>
            <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/> as "a system resource that is (a) required to be
              protected by an information system's security policy, (b) intended to be protected by
              a countermeasure, or (c) required for a system's mission.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Asset characterization <list>
            <t>Asset characterization is the process of defining attributes that describe properties
              of an identified asset.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Asset Management <list>
            <t> The process by which assets are provisioned, updated, maintained and deprecated.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Asset Targeting <list>
            <t>Asset targeting is the use of asset identification and categorization information to
              drive human-directed, automated decision making for data collection and analysis in
              support of endpoint posture assessment.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Attribute <list>
            <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "data element including any requisite
              meta-data describing an observed, expected, or the operational status of an endpoint
              feature (e.g., anti-virus software is currently in use)."</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Broker <list>
          <t>An entity providing and/or connecting services on the behalf of other architectural components.  Within the SACM Architecture, for example, a broker may provide authorization services and find, upon request, entities providing requested services.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t> Building Block <list>
            <t> For SACM, a building block is a unit of functionality that may apply to more than
              one use case and can be supported by different components of an architectural model.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Capability <list>
          <t>The extent of an architectural component's ability.  For example, a Posture Information Provider may only provide endpoint management data, and then only a subset of that data.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>Client <list>
          <t>An architectural component receiving services from another architectural component.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t> Collection Task <list>
            <t> The process by which posture attributes or values are collected.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Consumer <list>
          <t>An architectural component receiving information from another architectrual component.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Endpoint <list>
            <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "any computing device that can be connected to
              a network. Such devices normally are associated with a particular link layer address
              before joining the network and potentially an IP address once on the network. This
              includes: laptops, desktops, servers, cell phones, or any device that may have an IP
              address."</t>
            <t>To further clarify the <xref target="RFC5209"/> definition, an endpoint is any
              physical or virtual device that may have a network address. Note that, network
              infrastructure devices (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls), which fit the definition,
              are also considered to be endpoints within this document.</t>
            <t>Based on the previous definition of an asset, an endpoint is a type of asset.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Evaluation Task <list>
            <t> The process by which posture attributes are evaluated.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Endpoint Target <list>
            <t> The endpoint of interest. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Endpoint Discovery <list>
            <t>The process by which an endpoint can be identified. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Evaluation Result <list>
            <t> The resulting value from having evaluated a set of posture attributes.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Expected Endpoint State <list>
            <t> The required state of an endpoint that is to be compared against. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Function <list>
          <t>A behavioral aspect of a particular architectural component, which belies that component's purpose.  For example, the Management Plane can provide a brokering function to other SACM architectrual components.</t>
        </list></t>


        <t> Information Model <list>
            <t> An information model is an abstract representation of data, their properties,
              relationships between data and the operations that can be performed on the data. While
              there is some overlap with a data model, <xref target="RFC3444"/> distinguished an
              information model as being protocol and implementation neutral whereas a data model
              would provide such details. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Management Plane (TBD per list; was "Control Plane") <list>
          <t>Architectural component providing common functions to all SACM participants, including authentication, authorization, capabilities mappings, and the like.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Posture <list>
            <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "configuration and/or status of hardware or
              software on an endpoint as it pertains to an organization's security policy."</t>
            <t>This term is used within the scope of this document to represent the state
              information that is collected from an endpoint (e.g. software/hardware inventory,
              configuration settings). The state information may constitute one to many Posture
              Attributes.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Posture Attributes <list>
            <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "attributes describing the configuration or
              status (posture) of a feature of the endpoint. A Posture Attribute represents a single
              property of an observed state. For example, a Posture Attribute might describe the
              version of the operating system installed on the system."</t>
            <t>Within this document this term represents a specific assertion about endpoint state
              (e.g. configuration setting, installed software, hardware). The phrase "features of
              the endpoint" refers to installed software or software components.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Provider <list>
          <t>An architectural component providing information to another architectrual component.</t>
        </list></t>

        </list></t>
        <t>Repository <list>
          <t>An architectural component intended to store information of a particular kind.  A single repository may provide the functions of more than one repository type (i.e. configuration baseline repository, assessment results repository, etc.)</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>Role <list>
          <t>A label representing a collection of functions provided by a particular architectural component.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t> Security Automation <list>
            <t> The process of which security alerts can be automated through the use of different
              tools to monitor, evaluate and analyze endpoint and network traffic for the purposes
              of detecting misconfigurations, misbehaviors or threats. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Supplicant <list>
          <t>The entity seeking to be authenticated by the Management Plane for the purpose of participating in the SACM architecture.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>System Resource <list>
            <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/> as "data contained in an information system; or a
              service provided by a system; or a system capacity, such as processing power or
              communication bandwidth; or an item of system equipment (i.e., hardware, firmware,
              software, or documentation); or a facility that houses system operations and
              equipment.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
